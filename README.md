# 3D Point cloud coloring (PIDR - 2024)

## Overview

This project aims to develop a real-time algorithm to colorize 3D point clouds captured by a LiDAR scanner using a camera, all within a ROS2 environment. Created by [Yamine Boualit](https://github.com/yamineb57) and [Samir Abdallah](https://github.com/samir-adh) in collaboration with the [LORIA](https://www.loria.fr/fr/), this project was undertaken as part of the PIDR program at [TELECOM Nancy](https://telecomnancy.univ-lorraine.fr/).

## Demonstration

This project has been tested on the [KITTI Dataset](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/) :
